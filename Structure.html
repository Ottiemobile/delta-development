            paragraph functions can be used to create paragraphs that can either be <br>
            fairly short or extremely long, along with the break function which is basically <br>
            the letters "br" between the less than and greater than sign to create line breaks<br>
            that could make paragraphs and other forms of text to fit within the computer screen.<br>
